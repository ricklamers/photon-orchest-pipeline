## Photon + Orchest

[![Open in Orchest](https://github.com/orchest/orchest-examples/raw/main/imgs/open_in_orchest.svg)](https://cloud.orchest.io/?import_url=https://github.com/ricklamers/photon-orchest-pipeline/)

This is a simple Orchest pipeline that demonstrates how to leverage the https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon project to run simple scraping pipelines.

You can try it out by clicking the "Import git project" in the Orchest projects view or by running `git clone https://github.com/ricklamers/photon-orchest-pipeline` in the `orchest/userdir/projects/` directory.
